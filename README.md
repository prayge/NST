# NST

Neural Style Transfer is the process of blending a *style* from an image you would like to extract the visual properties from, onto a *content* image while keeping spatial information. Its an application of computer vision using Convolutional Neural Networks. The NST employs a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network to activate the neurons in a particular way so that the content and style match to preserve content image spatial information while imposing style aspects to the output.
